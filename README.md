# Would You Rather Project

This is the project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The"Would You Rather?" app lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In yapp, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

To start the application: 

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that are used to access the data in the application.

Following is the flow of the application:

	/ --/Login ---------/Home
	  |				|   /Create Question
	  |				|	/Leader Board	
	  |	            |   /Logout
	  |			    |
	  --/Register --
